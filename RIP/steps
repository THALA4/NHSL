Practical 

Connecting networks using RIP(Routing information Protocol)

Router acts as a Network service provider who is providing IP Addresses to the PCs underlying it
STEPS:
PC, Switch, Router
Here we will also give Default Gateway as Network IP i.e. Routers IP,
Set routers IP as well and Turn it ON
Then in router to router, hover it and assign 3rd network IP that can be 10.10.10.10
Then Same for the 2nd router, but here when assigning it for router to router we will give 10.20.30.40

Now Comes the RIP part
In router go to RIP, You have to add 2, i.e. 192.168.1.0 or 2.0 AND 10.0.0.0
